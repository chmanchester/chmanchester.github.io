I’ve been an employee at the Mozilla Corporation working on test infrastructure
and tools for about a year. In summer of 2013 I was an intern at the same, and
before that a contributor.

In the intervening months I attended the University of Pennsylvania, where I was
assigned reading such as [Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html),
and formed some opinions on the subject. In retrospect I think my primary
attraction to languages like Haskell was that I found it easy to write correct and
powerful programs in them, and this was a lot of fun. More recently I’ve come to
believe I was not measuring my experience by the most important criteria, although
just the other day I was suffering from a lack of concatMap in python. (Due to duck
typing, `sum([[1], [2, 3]], [])` is `[1, 2, 3]`, conveniently).

These days my favorite functional programming language is JavaScript[^fn].

[^fn]: I tend to agree [programming paradigms are on their way out](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/paper.pdf).
